In the 1970s, many Brazilians drove cars with engines that used an ethanol gasoline mixture. This alternative fuel conserved the limited supply of gasoline available at that time.

      "The balloon and the comb have the same electrical charge.": "The balloon and the comb have the same electrical charge, which causes the comb to repel the balloon when they are placed near each other after each has been rubbed against hair.",
      "The balloon has a negative charge and the comb is neutral.": "The balloon has a negative charge and the comb is neutral, which explains why the comb repels the balloon after the students rub the balloon against their hair several times and pass the comb through hair several times and then place the comb near the balloon.",

    "question": "Excess nitrogen fertilizers sometimes drain into waterways that flow into the Chesapeake Bay. This nitrogen may cause algae blooms, which reduce dissolved oxygen in the water. How does nitrogen negatively affect the Chesapeake Bay?",
    "choices": {
      "fish births increase": "Fish births increase is how excess nitrogen from fertilizers negatively affects the Chesapeake Bay, because the nitrogen causes algae blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.",
      "fish populations decrease": "Fish populations decrease when excess nitrogen from fertilizers drains into waterways that flow into the Chesapeake Bay, triggering algae blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.",
      "sediment on the bottom of the bay decreases": "Sediment on the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay decreases when excess nitrogen fertilizers drain into its waterways, causing algae blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen.",
      "the rate of water runoff into the bay increases": "The rate of water runoff into the Chesapeake Bay increases because excess nitrogen fertilizers drain into the waterways feeding the bay, leading to algae blooms that reduce dissolved oxygen in the water."
